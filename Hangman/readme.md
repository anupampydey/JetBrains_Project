This is a Python script of the classic game “Hangman”. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes. If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions. The player has only 8 wrong turns to guess the word, ie a player loses a turn if he guesses the wrong alphabet letter. For guessing the correct letter does not loses his turn. The current game is for guessing a programming language, but you can easily customize the game by changing the variables.
