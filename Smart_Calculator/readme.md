## Smart Calculator

A Smart Calculator supports 5 basic operations: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction and exponentiation 
operation. But also has the ability to calculate expressions containing parenthesis and the ability to remember the

This Python script replicates a smart calculator by calculating the sum, subtraction, multiplication, integer division 
and power of numbers and at the same time supports variables, parentheses. The program uses Infix expression as an input, converts it into an Postfix expression and then evaluates it result.<br><br>
