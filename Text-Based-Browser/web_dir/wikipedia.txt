From today's featured articleThe Tweed Courthouse (officially the Old New York County Courthouse) is a historic courthouse building in Civic Center, Manhattan, New York City. Listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and protected as a New York City designated landmark, it is the second-oldest city-government building in Manhattan, after City Hall. It was built in the Italianate style, with Romanesque Revival interiors, under the leadership of William M. "Boss" Tweed, whose political machine, Tammany Hall, controlled the city and state governments when the courthouse was built. Architect John Kellum designed the original two wings of the building, which was constructed from 1861 to 1872. The project was completed by architect Leopold Eidlitz, who added the rear wing and finished the interior between 1877 and 1881. Modern restoration and historic preservation were completed in 2001.

List of historical anniversariesToday's featured pictureCatherine Brass Yates is an oil-on-canvas painting created in 1793–1794 by American artist Gilbert Stuart. The work depicts Yates, the wife of a New York merchant, with her bony face and appraising glance, as too busy with her sewing to take time off to pose for the artist. The fabrics, skin tones and sewing implements are illustrated using a variety of thick, thin, opaque and translucent oil paints, and a meticulous attention to detail. The subject wears a mobcap, a round, gathered or pleated cloth, to cover her hair. This was an indoor fashion item of the period, and would have been worn under a hat for outdoor wear. The painting was acquired in 1940 by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., where it hangs today.
