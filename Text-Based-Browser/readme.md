Text-Based-Browser is one of the JetBrains project for parsing of web pages.
The python script currently parses only the text of the webpages.

The python script runs on the Windows command line prompt
>python browser.py <dir_name> 
(dir_name refers to creation of new directory if it does not exists in the current directory)
After parsing the webpages, the pages are saved in the newly created directory folder.

The smooth running of the script depends on the "requirements.txt"
